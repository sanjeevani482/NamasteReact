    <!-- CDN links for React 
    CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. A CDN is a network of servers that are located around the world and work together to deliver web content to users based on their location -->


    <!-- Subresource Integrity. Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched resource must match -->
